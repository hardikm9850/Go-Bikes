# üö≤ GoBikes - Rent Bike Backend API

GoBikes is a simple backend service designed for a bike rental application. The primary motivation behind this project is to explore **backend engineering**, understand its complexities, and apply key concepts like **database management**, **API development**, and **performance optimization**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This project is created purely for **learning purposes** and is not intended for production use.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

- **Programming Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Web Framework**: [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) - Fast HTTP framework for Go
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: GORM
- **API Testing**: Postman / Curl
- **Tools**: Docker (optional), Git

---

## üìö **Features**

1. **Vehicle Listing**:  
   - Exposes an API to list all vehicles filtered by location.  
   - Sorts vehicles based on their base cost.  

2. **Cost Calculation**:  
   - API to calculate the final cost based on selected start and end time.  
   - Applies rules like base pricing, hourly charges, and kilometer limits.

3. **Booking Management**:  
   - Place an order to rent a bike for a certain duration.  
   - Generates a unique **order ID** upon successful booking.

4. **Data Relationships**:  
   - Handles relationships between **vehicles**, **locations**, and **costs** using foreign keys.
  
5. **JWT based authentication**

## üöÄ **API Endpoints [WIP] ‚è≥ ** 

| **Method** | **Endpoint**                                      | **Description**                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `GET`      | `/vehicle/{location_name}`                       | List all vehicles in the specified location.  |
| `GET`      | `/vehicle/{location_name}/{vehicle_id}/{start_time}/{end_time}` | Retrieve the final rental cost.               |
| `POST`     | `/order/vehicle`                                 | Place an order for renting a vehicle.         |

### Example Request: Place an Order
**Endpoint**: `/order/vehicle`  
**Method**: `POST`  
**Request Body**:
```json
{
    "vehicle_id": "1234",
    "start_time": "1734420600",
    "end_time": "1734442200"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
    "order_id": "ORD123456",
    "message": "Booking successful"
}
```
